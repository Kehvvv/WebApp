Ideas to implement:
- banner image across the top of the page
- hover animation to show/hide form
- link to amazon page with search results for each game
- search across other fields (not only game title) --expand search functionality
- form validation (Ensure no blanks, etc)
- delete

Fixes to be made:
- general styling (colors, fonts, etc)
- hide table until search is made
